      My name is Richard or Ritchie I am 37 years old. I was born in Scotland but moved to Norwich when I was less than a year old because of my my dad work. I have done alot in my life including travelljng across america over a month driving and flying some of it. Walked up mountains, volcanos and glaciers. I was a teacher for 15 years in schools and colleges teaching sport and public services. i like to get out looking at historical sights and just enjoying walking, play a little xbox. But my big passion is Lego it relaxes me and i enjoy the end product. i have over 400 sets of lego from all years and sets.

I was diagnosed with diabeties when I was 5 just after my birthday. 5 years ago I found out I had kidney failure with only 9% function overall in both kidneys. they disrupted my rugby work and life style. I was put on the transplant list and on dialaysis which meant i had to pump warm
fluid in and out of my body for 5 months before I got the call that a transplant had come available, and on the 6th of Feburary 2019 I had a kidney and pancreas double transplant. Which means I no longer have diabeties and I dont have kidney failure. Recently diagnosed with ASD and ADHD which can sometimes affect me as a person.
